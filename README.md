# SQL
RDBMS

It is a software system that allows users to create, maintain, and access databases. RDBMSs are based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables. Each table is made up of rows and columns, and each row represents a single record. 


Non Relational Database


A non-relational database (also known as a NoSQL database) is a database that does not use the tabular structure of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems. Instead, non-relational databases use a storage model that is optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored.
Example Graph database, document database.
